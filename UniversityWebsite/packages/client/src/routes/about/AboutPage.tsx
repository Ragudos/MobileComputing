                            Founded in 2005 in Sigma City, Sigma University was
                            established to meet the growing demand for globally
                            competitive graduates in technology, business,
                            healthcare, and the arts. What began with just three
                            programs and fewer than 500 students has evolved
                            into a thriving institution known for innovation,
                            leadership, and service.
